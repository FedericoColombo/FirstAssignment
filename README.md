First Assignment:
Last week we created this repository to upload our fisrt assignment. Pietro added me as coordinator to better work together.
This week we worked with R using two datasets and illustrating some basic distributionts relevant to the data by using simple descriptive statistics.

We linked the files, so sourceP.R runs datawomen.R
